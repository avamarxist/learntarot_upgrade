In medieval courts, the court jester was someone who was not expected to follow the same rules as others. He could observe and then poke fun. This makes the Fool unpredictable and full of surprises. He reminds us of the unlimited potential and spontaneity inherent in every moment. There is a sense with this card that anything goes - nothing is certain or regular. The Fool adds the new and unfamiliar to a situation.The Fool also represents the complete faith that life is good and worthy of trust. Some might call the Fool too innocent, but his innocence sustains him and brings him joy. In readings, the Fool can signal a new beginning or change of direction - one that will guide you onto a path of adventure, wonder and personal growth. He also reminds you to keep your faith and trust your natural responses. If you are facing a decision or moment of doubt, the Fool tells you to believe in yourself and follow your heart no matter how crazy or foolish your impulses may seem.See also the Fool's Journey."},{"cardID":"maj01","title":"Magician","suit":"Major","links":"maj01.htm","smImg":"maj01s.gif","opposing":["maj02","maj12","c7","s4","s8"],"reinforcing":["maj07","w2","w8","p8"],"prevCard":"maj00","actions":[{"act":"taking action","sub":["doing what needs to be done","realizing your potential","making what's possible real","practicing what you preach","carrying out plans","producing magical results","using your talents"]},{"act":"acting consciously","sub":["knowing what you are doing and why","acknowledging your motivations","understanding your intentions","examining the known situation"]},{"act":"concentrating","sub":["having singleness of purpose","being totally committed","applying the force of your will","feeling centered","setting aside distractions","focusing on a goal"]},{"act":"experiencing power","sub":["making a strong impact","having vitality","creating miracles","becoming energized","feeling vigorous","being creative"]}],"description":"The Magician is the archetype of the active, masculine principle - the ultimate achiever. He symbolizes the power to tap universal forces and use them for creative purposes. Note his stance in the picture. He acts as a lightening rod - one arm extended up into the Divine for inspiration, the other pointing toward Earth to ground this potent energy. [note] His abilities appear magical at times because his will helps him achieve what seem to be miracles.What makes the Magician so powerful? First, he is not afraid to act. He believes in himself and is willing to put that belief on the line. He also knows what he intends to do and why. He doesn't hesitate because he understands his situation exactly. The Magician can focus with single-minded determination. As long as he remembers the divine source of his power, the Magician remains the perfect conduit for miracles. In a reading, the Magician implies that the primal forces of creativity are yours if you can claim your power and act with awareness and concentration. This card is a signal to act and act now, provided you understand exactly what you want and are committed to getting it.

She contains within herself the secrets of these realms and offers us the silent invitation, \"Be still and know that I am God.\"The High Priestess is the feminine principle that balances the masculine force of the Magician. The feminine archetype in the tarot is split between the High Priestess and the Empress. The High Priestess is the mysterious unknown that women often represent, especially in cultures that focus on the tangible and known. The Empress represents woman's role as the crucible of life. In readings, the High Priestess poses a challenge to you to go deeper - to look beyond the obvious, surface situation to what is hidden and obscure. She also asks you to recall the vastness of your potential and to remember the unlimited possibilities you hold within yourself. The High Priestess can represent a time of waiting and allowing. It is not always necessary to act to achieve your goals. Sometimes they can be realized through a stillness that gives desire a chance to flower within the fullness of time.See also the Fool's Journey."},{"cardID":"maj03","title":"Empress","suit":"Major","links":"maj03.htm","smImg":"maj03s.gif","opposing":["maj04","maj13","p4","p9"],"reinforcing":["maj06","maj17","c9","p7","p10"],"prevCard":"maj02","actions":[{"act":"mothering","sub":["giving birth","nourishing life","nurturing and caring for others","cherishing the world","expressing tenderness","working with children"]},{"act":"welcoming abundance","sub":["enjoying extravagance","receiving lavish reward","luxuriating in plenty","having more than enough","feeling rich"]},{"act":"experiencing the senses","sub":["giving and receiving pleasure","focusing on the body","appreciating beauty","feeling vibrantly healthy","being earthy","doing physical activity"]},{"act":"responding to Nature","sub":["relating to plants and animals","embracing the natural","feeling connected to the Earth","going outdoors","harmonizing with natural rhythms"]}],"description":"The Empress and the High Priestess are the two halves of the female archetype in the major arcana. The Empress represents the fertile, life-giving Mother who reigns over the bounty of nature and the rhythms of the Earth. From her comes all the pleasures and joys of the senses and the abundance of new life in all its forms. The Empress encourages you to strengthen your connections with the natural world which is the ground of our being. Too often false sophistications and pleasures take us far from our roots. Let the Empress remind you to keep your feet firmly planted in the Earth.In readings the Empress can refer to any aspect of Motherhood. She can be an individual mother, but as a major arcana card, she also goes beyond the specifics of mothering to its essence - the creation of life and its sustenance through loving care and attention.The Empress can also represent lavish abundance of all kinds. She offers a cornucopia of delights, especially those of the senses - food, pleasure and beauty. She can suggest material reward, but only with the understanding that riches go with a generous and open spirit.

We see a stern, commanding figure seated on a stone-slab throne. His back is straight, and his eyes meet ours directly. He is confident of his complete authority to rule.The Emperor represents structure, order and regulation - forces to balance the free-flowing, lavish abundance of the Empress. He advocates a four-square world where trains are on time, games are played by rules, and commanding officers are respected. In chaotic situations, the Emperor can indicate the need for organization. Loose ends should be tied up, and wayward elements, harnessed. In situations that are already over-controlled, he suggests the confining effect of those constraints.The Emperor can represent an encounter with authority or the assumption of power and control. As the regulator, he is often associated with legal matters, disciplinary actions, and officialdom in all its forms. He can also stand for an individual father or archetypal Father in his role as guide, protector and provider.See also the Fool's Journey."},{"cardID":"maj05","title":"Hierophant","suit":"Major","links":"maj05.htm","smImg":"maj05s.gif","opposing":["maj00","maj06","w2","s7","p2"],"reinforcing":["maj04","c3","p3","p8","p10"],"prevCard":"maj04","actions":[{"act":"getting an education","sub":["pursuing knowledge","becoming informed","increasing understanding","studying and learning","seeking a deeper meaning","finding out more"]},{"act":"having a belief system","sub":["sharing a cultural heritage","learning a religious tradition","honoring ritual and ceremony","identifying a world view","following a discipline","knowing where to put your faith"]},{"act":"conforming","sub":["following the rules","taking an orthodox approach","staying within conventional bounds","adapting to the system","fitting in","going along with the program","doing what's expected","being part of the Establishment"]},{"act":"identifying with a group","sub":["being committed to a cause","devoting energy to a group","joining an organization","working as part of a team","feeling loyal to others","being in an institutionalized setting"]}],"description":"Except in rare cases, every human grows and develops within a culture. We learn by living with others. The Hierophant represents such official learning, especially in groups. A Hierophant is someone who interprets secret knowledge. On Card 5 we see a religious figure in a formal church setting. He is wearing the elaborate vestments of his office. His task is to bring the two initiates into the church so they can take up their appointed roles.Besides churches, there are schools, clubs, teams, companies, and societies. The Hierophant represents all of these because his realm is structured groups with rules and assigned roles. Such environments emphasize belief systems - facts, rules, procedures, and ritual. Members are rewarded for following conventions. They develop a group identity. The Hierophant is one of three cards that focuses on the group. (The 3 of Cups and the 3 of Pentacles are the others.)In readings, the Hierophant often represents learning with experts or knowledgeable teachers. This card also stands for institutions and their values. The Hierophant is a symbol of the need to conform to rules or fixed situations. His appearance in a reading can show that you are struggling with a force that is not innovative, free-spirited or individual. Groups can be enriching or stifling, depending on circumstances. Sometimes we need to follow a program or embrace tradition, other times, we need to trust ourselves.See also the Fool's Journey."},{"cardID":"maj06","title":"Lovers","suit":"Major","links":"maj06.htm","smImg":"maj06s.gif","opposing":["maj05","maj09","c5","s3"],"reinforcing":["maj03","c2","c9","c10","p10"],"prevCard":"maj05","actions":[{"act":"relating","sub":["establishing bonds","feeling love","forming a union or marriage","acknowledging kinship","sympathizing with another","getting closer","making a connection","being intimate"]},{"act":"being sexual","sub":["seeking union","experiencing desire","making love","opening to another","responding with passion","feeling a physical attraction","tapping inner energy"]},{"act":"establishing personal beliefs","sub":["questioning received opinions","figuring out where you stand","staying true to yourself","setting your own philosophy","going by your own standards","making up your own mind"]},{"act":"determining values","sub":["struggling with temptation","choosing between right and wrong","facing an ethical or moral choice","refusing to let ends justify means","finding out what you care about"]}],"description":"The Lovers is one card that is easy to remember. Love and sex are riveting subjects, and, as you'd expect, this card represents both. The urge for union is powerful, and, in its highest form, takes us beyond ourselves. That is why an angel is blessing the bond between the man and woman on this card.In readings, Card 6 often refers to a relationship that is based on deep love - the strongest force of all. The relationship may not be sexual, although it often is or could be. More generally, the Lovers can represent the attractive force that draws any two entities together in a relationship - whether people, ideas, events, movements or groups.Card 6 can also stand for tough value choices and the questioning that goes with them. In some decks, the Lovers shows a man torn between two women - a virgin and a temptress. This rather old-fashioned triangle symbolizes the larger dilemmas we face when we are tempted between right and wrong.The Lovers can indicate a moral or ethical crossroads - a decision point where you must choose between the high road or the low road. This card can also represent your personal beliefs because to make such a decision you must know where you stand. Following your own path can mean going against those who are urging you in a direction that is wrong for you.See also the Fool's Journey."},{"cardID":"maj07","title":"Chariot","suit":"Major","links":"maj07.htm","smImg":"maj07s.gif","opposing":["maj08","maj12","maj16","s8","s10"],"reinforcing":["maj01","w2","w6","p4","p9"],"prevCard":"maj06","actions":[{"act":"achieving victory","sub":["reaching your goal","winning","being successful","dominating","coming out on top","beating the competition"]},{"act":"using your will","sub":["being determined to succeed","focusing your intent","rising above temptation","letting nothing distract you","sustaining an effort","concentrating your energies","fixing on a goal"]},{"act":"asserting yourself","sub":["being ego-focused","establishing an identify","knowing who you are","feeling self-confident","having faith in yourself","looking out for your interests"]},{"act":"achieving hard control","sub":["mastering emotions","curbing impulses","maintaining discipline","holding in anger","getting your way","assuming the reins of power","showing authority"]}],"description":"Picture Julius Caesar riding his chariot triumphantly into Rome. He has defeated his enemies and conquered vast, new lands. This is the spirit of the Chariot. Card 7 represents the victories that are possible through willpower and self-mastery. A military image is appropriate for the Chariot because this card stands for the strengths associated with combat - discipline, grit, determination and assertiveness.The Chariot represents the positive aspects of the ego. A healthy ego is one that is strong and self-assured. It knows what it wants and how to get it. We can get annoyed at someone whose ego is too healthy, but we often turn to that person to lead us through difficult moments. We know he or she won't be wishy-washy.In readings, the Chariot often appears when hard control is or could be in evidence. At its best, hard control is not brutal, but firm and direct. It is backed up by a strong will and great confidence. The Chariot can mean self-control or control of the environment. This card also represents victory. There are many types of wins; the Chariot's is of the win-lose type. Your success comes from beating the competition to become number one. Such moments are glorious in the right circumstances.See also the Fool's Journey."},{"cardID":"maj08","title":"Strength","suit":"Major","links":"maj08.htm","smImg":"maj08s.gif","opposing":["maj07","c8","s6","p5"],"reinforcing":["maj12","w9"],"prevCard":"maj07","actions":[{"act":"showing strength","sub":["knowing you can endure","having a gallant spirit","feeling an unshakable resolve","taking heart despite setbacks","having stamina","being a rock"]},{"act":"being patient","sub":["dealing calmly with frustration","accepting others","taking time","maintaining composure","refusing to get angry","showing forbearance"]},{"act":"being compassionate","sub":["giving others lots of space","tolerating","understanding what others are feeling","accepting","forgiving imperfection","being kind"]}],"description":"Usually we think of strength in physical terms - big arms, powerful legs - but there is also inner strength. Inner strength comes from an exercise of the heart muscle. It is perseverance, courage, resolve and composure - qualities that help us endure when times are tough. In the past, a person with inner strength was commonly said to have character; he or she could be counted on in the darkest moments. Card 8 represents this energy of quiet determination. Strength is not a flashy card, but one that is solid and reliable.Card 8 also represents patience and compassion. Getting angry is easy when events turn sour, but dealing calmly with frustration takes great strength. So does accepting others and forgiving mistakes. We need strength to mold situations softly. The Chariot controls through mastery and authority. Card 8 is more subtle, even loving. Notice how the lion (itself a symbol of strength) is being guided and tamed by the woman's gentle hands.   Card 8 will appear in a reading when its qualities are needed. It can be a reminder not to despair or give up. You have the inner strength to endure and triumph. If you are pushing too hard, you need to withdraw for the moment and be patient. If other people or circumstances are driving you crazy, remember the strength that comes with love and forbearance. These will see you through the hardest moments.See also the Fool's Journey."},{"cardID":"maj09","title":"Hermit","suit":"Major","links":"maj09.htm","smImg":"maj09s.gif","opposing":["maj06","maj21","c2","c3","c3"],"reinforcing":["maj02","c4","c8","s4","s7"],"prevCard":"maj08","actions":[{"act":"being introspective","sub":["thinking things over","focusing inward","concentrating less on the senses","quieting yourself","looking for answers within","needing to understand"]},{"act":"searching","sub":["seeking greater understanding","looking for something","wanting the truth at all costs","going on a personal quest","needing more","desiring a new direction"]},{"act":"receiving\/giving guidance","sub":["going to\/being a mentor","accepting\/offering wise counsel","learning from\/being a guru","turning to\/being a trusted teacher","being helped\/helping"]}],"description":"The traditional hermit is a crusty, bearded character who has withdrawn from the company of men to live a life of seclusion and hardship. Card 9 supports this understanding. The Hermit represents the desire to turn away from the getting and spending of society to focus on the inner world. He seeks answers within and knows that they will come only with quiet and solitude. There comes a point in life when we begin to question the obvious. We sense that there is a deeper reality and begin to search for it. This is mainly a solitary quest because answers do not lie in the external world, but in ourselves. The hermit on Card 9 reminds us of Diogenes, the Greek ascetic who is said to have gone out with a lantern in hand to search for an honest man. Diogenes is a symbol of the search for truth that the Hermit hopes to uncover by stripping away all diversions.In readings, the Hermit often suggests a need for time alone - a period of reflection when distractions are limited. In times of action and high energy, he stands for the still center that must be created for balance. He can also indicate that withdrawal or retreat is advised for the moment. In addition, the Hermit can represent seeking of all kinds, especially for deeper understanding or the truth of a situation. \"Seek, and ye shall find,\" we have been told, and so the Hermit stands for guidance as well. We can receive help from wise teachers, and, in turn, help others as we progress.See also the Fool's Journey."},{"cardID":"maj10","title":"Wheel Of Fortune","suit":"Major","links":"maj10.htm","smImg":"maj10s.gif","opposing":["s2","s4","p4","p7"],"reinforcing":["w8"],"prevCard":"maj09","actions":[{"act":"feeling a sense of destiny","sub":["using what chance offers","seeing life's threads weave together","finding opportunity in an accident","opening to luck","sensing the action of fate","witnessing miracles"]},{"act":"being at a turning point","sub":["reversing","moving in a different direction","turning things around","having a change in fortune","altering the present course","being surprised at a turn of events"]},{"act":"feeling movement","sub":["experiencing change","having the tempo of life speed up","being swept up in new developments","rejoining the world of activity","getting involved"]}],"description":"In Greek mythology, there are three women known as the Fates. They are responsible for spinning the destiny of each person at his or her birth. It is not surprising that the Fates are spinners because the wheel of fortune is an apt image for the elusive turns of a man's fate. This is the theme of Card 10.The Wheel of Fortune is one of the few cards in the major arcana that does not have a human figure as a focal point. This is because its center is above the realm of man - in the higher levels (clouds) where the destinies of all are woven together in the tapestry of life. The tarot recognizes that each person sets his own path in life, but is also subject to the larger cycles that include him. We experience chance events that appear to be accidents although they are part of the great plan.In readings, the Wheel of Fortune can indicate a vision or realization that strikes with great force. If you've been struggling with a problem or tough situation, this card can signal that you will find the answer if you stand back and view everything from a larger perspective.The Wheel of Fortune also represents unexpected encounters and twists of fate. You can't predict surprises; you can only be aware when one is circling around. Indeed, Card 10 often suggests wheel-like actions - changes in direction, repeating cycles and rapid movement. When the energy of the Wheel arrives, you will feel life speed up. You are caught in a cyclone that may deposit you anywhere. \"Round and round and round she goes, and where she stops, nobody knows.\"See also the Fool's Journey."},{"cardID":"maj11","title":"Justice","suit":"Major","links":"maj11.htm","smImg":"maj11s.gif","opposing":["s2","s5","s7"],"reinforcing":["maj04","maj20","w10","s9","p7"],"prevCard":"maj10","actions":[{"act":"respecting justice","sub":["insisting on fairness","acting on ethical principles","being involved in legal concerns","committing to honesty","seeking equality","being impartial","trying to do what is right"]},{"act":"assuming responsibility","sub":["settling old accounts and debts","being accountable","acknowledging the truth","admitting involvement","handling the situation","doing what has to be done"]},{"act":"preparing for a decision","sub":["weighing all sides of an issue","setting a course for the future","balancing all factors","determining right action","choosing with full awareness"]}],"description":"On Card 11 we see the familiar figure of Justice. She has the scales of equality and impartial judgment in one hand, and the sword of decision in the other. In the tarot, Justice represents the understanding that life is ultimately fair and just. Even though the vagaries of day-to-day life tend to make us doubt this fact, Justice reminds us that there is divine balance. Notice the similarity between the Emperor and Justice. Both cards stand for universal order; the Emperor in its underlying structure, Justice, in the action of karma - cause and effect. There is a serious feel to Card 11 - the tone of the courtroom. This card refers to legal matters of all kinds, but is not restricted to them. The courts are where judgments are made and decisions rendered. Our legal system is the official arena in which we explore the principles of Justice - fairness, impartiality and the quest for truth.In readings, Justice often appears when you are concerned with doing what is right or making sure you receive your due. This card can also appear when you are feeling the impact of a past mistake or good deed. The cause you set in motion at one time is now returning to you as an effect.Sometimes Justice is a signal to do what needs to be done. A time comes when responsibilities must be accepted, and accounts settled. The past will continue to haunt you if you do not recognize your mistakes and make amends for them.

It is simple, but complex. It attracts, but also disturbs. It contradicts itself in countless ways. The Hanged Man is unsettling because it symbolizes the action of paradox in our lives. A paradox is something that appears contradictory, and yet is true. The Hanged Man presents to us certain truths, but they are hidden in their opposites.The main lesson of the Hanged Man is that we \"control\" by letting go - we \"win\" by surrendering. The figure on Card 12 has made the ultimate surrender - to die on the cross of his own travails - yet he shines with the glory of divine understanding. He has sacrificed himself, but he emerges the victor. The Hanged Man also tells us that we can \"move forward\" by standing still. By suspending time, we can have all the time in the world.In readings, the Hanged Man reminds us that the best approach to a problem is not always the most obvious. When we most want to force our will on someone, that is when we should release. When we most want to have our own way, that is when we should sacrifice. When we most want to act, that is when we should wait.

A powerful energy indeed. Who can look at the dark, skeletal figure on Card 13 and not feel uneasy? Here we see the face of our deepest fear - our greatest unknown. We recoil from Death because we think of it as annihilation. In the tarot (and in life I would suggest) Death is not a permanent end, but a transition into a new state. Life is eternal in its essence, if not in its form. To grow, to move, to live - we must \"die\" to the old to give birth to the new.It is a truism in tarot work that Card 13 rarely has anything to do with physical death. A responsible card reader never interprets Card 13 in this way because this view is too limiting. Death is not something that happens once to our bodies. It happens continually, at many levels and not just in the physical. Each moment we die to the present so the future can unfold.In readings, Death often represents an important ending that will initiate great change. It signals the end of an era; a moment when a door is closing. At such times, there may be sadness and reluctance, but also relief and a sense of completion. Death also suggests getting down to basics. Dying has a way of making you concentrate on what's important. This card reminds you to cut out the unnecessary. Death can also mean you will experience an inexorable force. Death is inevitable, and sometimes there are events that are inescapable as well.

Sensible, maybe, but also a bit boring? The energy of Temperance may seem unexciting on the surface, but it is the calm of a hurricane's eye. All around are swirling winds, but in the center is a still point that brings everything into balance.In readings, Temperance can represent a need for moderation, especially when extreme cards are present (such as the Knights). This card can also indicate a need for balance. In conflict situations, Temperance suggests that compromise and cooperation are vital. Look for any opportunity to bring opposing parties together. In fact, to temper can mean to modify by adding a new component. By combining and recombining, we come up with the ideal mixture or solution.

In fact, good and bad cannot be separated, just as you cannot separate a shadow from its source. Darkness is simply the absence of light, and it is caused by errors that hide the truth. Card 15 shows us these errors.First is ignorance - not knowing the truth and not realizing that we do not know. Second is materialism - the belief that there is nothing but the physical. As spiritual beings, we long for the Divine, but we lose contact with this source of truth if we trust only our senses. There is also hopelessness, which robs us of our joy and movement toward the light. Traditionally the Devil stands for evil, but it does not have this rather frightening meaning in a reading. This card lets you know that you are caught in an unhealthy, unproductive situation. You may be in the dark about something - ignorant of the truth and its implications. You may be obsessed by a person, idea, substance or pattern that you know is bad for you (or maybe you don't!). Sometimes this card reflects back the negativity that has made you doubt yourself and your future. We are prone to many errors in life. Card 15 lets us know when they are serious enough to require attention. When you see the Devil, examine your assumptions carefully. Make sure you are not working from a false picture of yourself and the situation. Hold fast to the highest vision of who you are.See also the Fool's Journey."},{"cardID":"maj16","title":"Tower","suit":"Major","links":"maj16.htm","smImg":"maj16s.gif","opposing":["maj07","maj14","maj17","w6","c10"],"reinforcing":["maj13","maj19","p5"],"prevCard":"maj15","actions":[{"act":"going through sudden change","sub":["experiencing upheaval","having plans disrupted","being surprised","undergoing a crisis","having routines shaken up","being in chaos"]},{"act":"releasing","sub":["exploding","having an emotional outburst","erupting in anger","crashing through ego defenses","breaking through pretense","letting everything go"]},{"act":"falling down","sub":["being humbled","experiencing a crash","toppling from the heights","having a downturn in fortune","suffering a blow to the ego"]},{"act":"having a revelation","sub":["suddenly realizing the truth","exposing what was hidden","having a burst of insight","seeing through illusions","getting the answer","seeing everything in a flash"]}],"description":"The Tower is an unsettling card. Fire, lightning, falling on jagged rocks - definitely looks like trouble! Card 16 will not be welcomed by those who dislike change. It represents a sudden, dramatic upheaval or reversal in fortune. Usually change is gradual, giving us time to adapt, but sometimes it is quick and explosive. This is the action of the Tower.In films, the hero sometimes slaps someone who is groggy or babbling. Having tried everything else, he finally resorts to a sharp sting to snap him out of it. Sudden crises are life's way of telling you to wake up. Something's wrong, and you're not responding. Are you too full of pride? Expect a blow to your ego. Are you holding back your anger? Expect the dam to burst. Are you stuck in a rut? Expect a surprise.How you respond to the Tower's change makes all the difference in how uncomfortable the experience will be. Recognize that the disruption occurred because it was needed. Perhaps embracing the change is too much to ask, but try to find the positive in it. In fact, you may feel tremendous release that you have finally been forced in a new direction. You may have a burst of insight about your situation and reach a new level of understanding about it.See also the Fool's Journey."},{"cardID":"maj17","title":"Star","suit":"Major","links":"maj17.htm","smImg":"maj17s.gif","opposing":["maj15","maj16","maj18","s2","s9"],"reinforcing":["maj00","maj03","c6","c10"],"prevCard":"maj16","actions":[{"act":"regaining hope","sub":["having faith in the future","thinking positively","believing","counting your blessings","seeing the light at the end of the tunnel","feeling great expectation","looking forward to success"]},{"act":"being inspired","sub":["regaining motivation","realizing an inner strength","seeing the way clear","being stimulated to a higher level","creating","receiving the answer"]},{"act":"being generous","sub":["wanting to give or share","spreading the wealth","opening your heart","giving back what you have received","letting love flow freely","offering with no reservations","holding nothing back"]},{"act":"feeling serene","sub":["experiencing peace of mind","relaxing","finding your still center","remaining untroubled","savoring perfect calm","being tranquil amid trouble","enjoying harmony"]}],"description":"People have always looked to the stars as a source of inspiration and hope. There is something about their twinkling light that draws us out of ourselves and up into a higher plane. When we turn our eyes heavenward, we no longer feel the distress of earth. The Star reminds me of the clear, high voice of a soprano. There is something otherworldly about it. All the harshness and density of everyday life has been refined away leaving only the purest essence. After being exposed to the Star, we feel uplifted and blessed.In readings, the Star is most welcome when grief and despair have overwhelmed us. In our darkest moments, we need to know that there is hope,that there is light at the end of the tunnel. The Star is the opposite of the Devil who strips us of our faith in the future. Card 17 holds out the promise that we can eventually find peace of mind. The Star also reminds us to open our heart and release our fears and doubt. If you have been holding back in any way, now is the time to give generously. It is important to remember that the Star is inspiring, but it is not a card of practical solutions or final answers. Truly without hope we can accomplish nothing, but hope is only a beginning. When you see Card 17, know that you are on the right track. Your goals and your aspirations are blessed, but to realize them, you must take positive action.

But...have you ever lost the familiar to find, in its place, a world so extraordinary you can't even grasp it? This is the experience of the Moon.Most of the time we live in a tiny pocket of normality that we wrap around us like a security blanket. We turn our backs on the mysterious universe that waits outside. From time to time we may sneak a peak with our imagination, or venture out through fantasy or expanded awareness. We can be thrust out there unprepared through drugs, madness or intense experiences such as battle.The Moon is the light of this realm - the world of shadow and night. Although this place is awesome, it does not have to be frightening. In the right circumstances, the Moon inspires and enchants. It holds out the promise that all you imagine can be yours. The Moon guides you to the unknown so you can allow the unusual into your life.Sadly, we are usually afraid of the Moon. In readings, this card often stands for fears and anxieties - the ones that come in the darkest part of the night. Card 18 also stands for illusions. It is easy to lose our way in the moonlight.

It is Judgment Day, when the faithful are brought to heaven, but what about those who are not saved? Have they been judged and found wanting? For their sins, will they be denied the presence of God? It is this aspect of judgment that is unsettling. How can judgment be reconciled with forgiveness?In fact, judgment comes in two forms. The hurtful kind says, \"What you did is wrong, and you are bad and worthless for having done it.\" This type of judgment separates and leaves no room for redemption. It is possible to judge without condemning. We assess the matter, weigh all sides and try to discern the truth. We recognize the need to choose and hope for the courage to do so wisely - but without blame.In readings, Card 20 can be a reminder that judgments are necessary; sometimes you must decide. At such moments, it is best to consider the matter carefully and then commit yourself without censure. If you are being judged yourself, learn from the process. Take what is of value, correct what needs correcting, but never lose sight of your worth.Card 20 also stands for the feelings that come with salvation. When the angel calls, you are reborn - cleansed of all guilts and burdens. The past and its mistakes are behind you, and you are ready to begin anew. You may even feel a calling - a personal conviction of what you are meant to do. If you are in a low period, in need of hope and absolution, Judgement can show you that renewal is at hand.

You're happy, fulfilled and truly thankful (at least until you have to start the dishes!). For this moment, the World and everything in it is yours.We all recognize this feeling. It can come at any time or place and is always welcome. We can feel it at home raking the leaves or on the world stage accepting the Nobel Prize. It can seem quiet and simple, or wild and glorious. What is this feeling, and where does it come from? Card 21 can help us find out.A major element of happiness is wholeness - the sense that everything is working together in harmony. Not in a static way, but with dynamic balance. Involvement is also important. To be happy, we must feel connected - engaged with what is around us. There is also accomplishment - knowing that we have goals and are moving toward them successfully. When all these elements come together, we feel fulfilled and blessed.The World represents these moments and all that goes into them. In readings, it is a very positive sign that you are in a position to realize your heart's desire. What that is for you depends on the situation, but it will always feel great.

It might be a creative idea, surge of optimism or need to act boldly. On the outside, it could be an offer, gift, opportunity, encounter or synchronistic event.When you see this Ace, examine your life to see how its potent, confident energy could work for you.

This card taps the same energy as the Magician, but with one important difference. The Magician represents the archetype of power - the impersonal energy of creativity and strength. The Two of Wands stands for that power brought down to Earth and made personal. Personal power is an invigorating force that fills you up and lends you the courage to be great. A powerful person is like a magnet that attracts all those within a certain area.True power always comes from the Divine. It passes through us and then flows out into the world. When we understand this relationship, we are blessed because this flow brings with it a tremendous feeling of expansion and fulfillment. We feel as if we can accomplish anything. Problems develop when we forget that we are not the source of power, only its conduit. We must be careful not to let the intoxicating feelings that come with power overwhelm our good sense and blind us to our true desires and intentions.In readings, the Two of Wands indicates that power is a major issue in the situation. You or someone else has it or wants it. When you see this card, look carefully at your goals and activities to make sure you are using power wisely. Don't support power for its own sake, but enjoy it when it serves your worthwhile purposes. Take this gift and use it to mold your environment in positive ways.The Two of Wands can also stand for an extra dose of daring and inventiveness.

From this height, he sees all that lies ahead. This is a card of vision and foresight. When we want to see farther, we climb higher. By going up, we increase our range and remove ourselves from the immediate situation. We detach and gain perspective.In readings, the Three of Wands can tell you to take the long view. Don't react to the heat of the moment, but step back and reconsider. See how the present fits into the greater picture. This card asks you to be a visionary - to dream beyond current limitations.  It can indicate premonitions or other intuitions about what is to come.Taking the long view is an aspect of leadership - another meaning of the Three of Wands. When we see far, we have the knowledge to guide others to their best future. Someone who knows the way can show it to those who follow. When you see the Three of Wands, know that now is the time to accept your vision and be confident that you can lead others to it.A leader not only sees far, but he is willing to go there first, if necessary. The Three of Wands is also a card of exploration. Compare this figure to the Fool who is also on a cliff edge. The Fool steps out in innocence, not realizing he is going to fall to his fate. The adventurer on the Three of Wands is also willing to step out, but with full awareness of what he is doing. His courage is more informed, if less spontaneous.

As a toddler, my son expressed it through his \"Happy Dance.\" He'd run in place faster and faster, barely able to control his delight. Of course, as mature(!) adults, we contain this feeling, but it never leaves completely. Each of us still has an excited, little kid inside waiting to come out.In readings, the Four of Wands often represents the events and experiences that generate excitement. These vary from person to person, but the stirring feelings are the same. Sometimes such times arrive unexpectedly. The Four of Wands can signal a surprise or spontaneous thrill. Other times this card represents planned celebrations, such as weddings, anniversaries, birthdays, and victory parties. These events have their solemn side, but they are also a chance to feel the joy of living. The Four of Wands often means freedom. Freedom can take many forms, but it always brings with it an exhilarating feeling. When we break the bonds that bind us, whether physical, mental or emotional, we feel triumphant and able to move on to a new period of growth and happiness. If you feel trapped or restricted right now, use the energy of the Four of Wands to launch you into freedom.

Nothing flows smoothly; everyone is working at cross-purposes. The figures on this card are all batting at each other. There is no coordinated effort, no agreement. When this card shows up, be prepared for a bumpy ride. You're going to need extra patience and perseverance to get to the point where you can accomplish something. The Five of Wands does not represent major blockages, just many small, irritating ones.This card also stands for competition. In the right circumstances, competition is useful. It fosters extra effort, generates excitement and encourages the best. When the Five of Wands appears in a reading, check for competitive elements. You may be involved in a contest, race or game.

You can see this dream in the faces of athletes, politicians, and other champions as they step into the winner's circle. It's all been worthwhile. I'm the best. I've won!In readings, the Six of Wands appears when you have been working hard toward a goal, and success is finally within reach. The recognition you have sought so long is yours. Now you can receive the acclaim, honor and reward that you deserve. If you do not feel close to victory now, know that it is on its way provided you are doing all you can to make it happen. The victory of this card does not have to involve beating someone else. You can triumph over yourself, the environment, or the odds.The Six of Wands also represents a healthy self-esteem. Feeling good about your accomplishments is an important part of success, but too much pride can lead to arrogance and self-inflation. When you see this card, check that you are not feeling superior to others.  It is easy to forget that individual achievement is not really individual at all. Our talents begin in the Divine, develop with the love and support of others, and only in the end express through us. How can we indulge in excess pride?In The Purgatorio Dante considers pride the first and greatest sin that must be overcome by souls reaching toward heaven. When the Six of Wands appears, enjoy your triumph, feel good about yourself, but remember Dante's words:O gifted men, vainglorious for first place,how short a time the laurel crown stays green............................................A breath of wind is all there is to famehere upon earth: it blows this way and that,and when it changes quarter it changes name."},{"cardID":"w7","title":"7 of Wands","suit":"Wands","links":"w7.htm","smImg":"w7s.gif","opposing":["maj02","maj12","p3"],"reinforcing":["w5","w9","s5"],"prevCard":"w6","actions":[{"act":"being aggressive","sub":["going after what you want","asserting yourself","taking the offensive","firing the first shot","fighting","making your point forcefully","seizing the advantage"]},{"act":"being defiant","sub":["holding out against pressure","defending your position","opposing all challengers","combating criticism","refusing to yield","saying \"No!\"","resisting authority"]},{"act":"showing conviction","sub":["being sure","having a fixed position","demonstrating strong character","standing up for what you believe","knowing you are right","acting resolutely","being firm"]}],"description":"The Seven of Wands is all about taking a stand.

We want to resist the flow, or change its course entirely!The figure on the Seven of Wands appears to be in a battle. He's either attacking or under attack, probably both. When we decide to take a stand, we set in motion an energy of resistance. When we take up a firm position, others do the same. The Seven of Wands stands for aggression and defiance because they are two sides of the same coin. You attack; your opponent defends. He counterattacks; you defend.Some battles are worth fighting, others just cause trouble. If you are involved in a conflict, ask yourself if it's worth the struggle. Is it important? Does it have value? Will the outcome serve you or others? If so, be bold and aggressive. Defend your position. Refuse to yield! If not, then consider letting the conflict go. Be honest with yourself about this. You will be tempted to hold onto your position, especially if you have invested much time and energy into it. Don't let battle lines be drawn unless the war is worth fighting.The Seven of Wands can also indicate strong convictions.

His staff is the agent of power that initiates events. Moses' staff reminds me of the wands on this card. They are a symbol of the onset of action and its effects. Before acting, we think, imagine, speculate, talk and dream. This is the realm of air - the sky. Then, finally, we decide to make our move. We bring our ideas down to earth and put them into action.In readings, the Eight of Wands is often a sign that now is the time to declare yourself. All the elements are ready and will work for you as long as you don't hesitate. The iron is hot - so strike! If events are in motion, they will proceed rapidly. You may feel caught in a whirlwind, but soon the dust will settle, and you see how your plans have fared.The Eight of Wands also stands for the arrival of news or information. You may see or hear something important. The news could show up in a disguised form, so stay alert. Pay attention to everything that comes your way for a while.This card also signifies endings. Sooner or later all activities run their course. The eight wands on this card not only symbolize putting events into motion, but also bringing them to a close. They appear to be ending their flight by coming down to earth. If you see the Eight of Wands in a reading, it may be time to conclude whatever you have been doing. Celebrate the past, but prepare to move on to something new.

His head and arm are bandaged, and he's leaning on a \"crutch.\" This fighter has seen some battles, but he's still standing! He's hurt, but he's not down. When we have had a bad experience, we feel weary and battle-scarred. Even if we aren't hurt physically, our psyches are wounded. Our openness, innocence and trust are gone, replaced by wary defensiveness.In readings, the Nine of Wands can be a warning that you must proceed carefully. Keep a watchful eye because there is the possibility that you will be hurt. If you have already been burned, you know what this man is feeling. Life's lessons can be hard sometimes, especially when hopes have been dashed. It is natural to feel defensive at such times, but try to avoid becoming bitter. Your experience has wounded you, but it has strengthened you as well.Strength is the other aspect of the Nine of Wands. This fighter is tough! He has the physical stamina and the inner drive to persist despite all setbacks. In The Terminator, Arnold Schwarzenegger plays an android from the future who never gives up.  In the end he is nothing but a wire framework with glowing eyes, but he still keeps coming - dragging himself along the floor to his goal. This is the spirit of the Nine of Wands.

We take on so much, trying to do all the things that need to be done. We think that if we can hang on until the weekend (or vacation, or end of the semester) then we can finally relax. The weekend comes, and the overload continues.In readings, the Ten of Wands can be a sign that you are pushing yourself too hard. If your days are an endless round of duties and tasks, then you need to lighten up for the sake of your health and well-being. Cut back, and take on only those activities that give you pleasure. If you love your work, but it's all-consuming, you may be too narrowly focused in one area. Balance your life with other interests.The Ten of Wands can also stand for times when you have to assume the lion's share of responsibility. You may be blamed or left holding the bag. On the other hand, you may have to step forward and take charge because you are the only one capable enough. Rightly or wrongly, the cleanup will fall to you.The Ten of Wands indicates that your life is going to be tougher than usual for a time. You will have to fight uphill for every little gain.

A man and a woman are gazing at each other, ready to share their cups (emotions). Here is the very picture of romantic and sexual attraction. The energy between these two is almost palpable. The Two of Cups shows the beauty and power that is created when two come together. This is the card that lovers want to see, and, in fact, the Two of Cups is the minor arcana equivalent of the Lovers in many ways.The Two of Cups has a deeper meaning as well. Whenever two forces are drawn together, there is the potential for bonding. This card can stand for the union of any two entities - people, groups, ideas, or talents. In readings, the Two of Cups tells you to look for connections in your life, especially those that are one-on-one. Now is not the time to separate or stay apart. It is the time to join with another and work as a partnership. If you are in conflict, look for truce and the chance to forgive and be forgiven. If you are struggling with two choices or tendencies within yourself, seek to reconcile them.Usually, the Two of Cups is welcome in a reading, but it can also sound a note of warning. The energy of Two can be very compelling. If you have ever stood next to two people in love, you know what I'm talking about. They create between themselves a world of their own that can feel exclusionary to outsiders. \"Two's company; three's a crowd.\" Make sure that the tendency to pair off is not creating disharmony in your situation."},{"cardID":"c3","title":"3 of Cups","suit":"Cups","links":"c3.htm","smImg":"c3s.gif","opposing":["maj09","w9","s3","s6","s9"],"reinforcing":["maj05","maj14","w4","p3"],"prevCard":"c2","actions":[{"act":"feeling exuberant","sub":["bursting with energy","being in the flow","celebrating","overflowing with high spirits","feeling on top of the world","dancing and singing","putting yourself out there"]},{"act":"enjoying friendship","sub":["getting together with people you like","experiencing camaraderie","extending\/receiving hospitality","sharing","finding companions","trusting others","relying on outside help"]},{"act":"valuing community","sub":["taking part in a support group","developing a team spirit","working together","uniting with others","forming a group bond","helping each other","discovering a common goal","being neighborly"]}],"description":"There are three cards in the tarot that focus on the group - each from a different point of view. For the Hierophant, it's the formal approach. For the Three of Pentacles it's teamwork, and for the Three of Cups, it's emotions. What does it feel like to join with others? What is friendship and community? These are the questions answered by the Three of Cups.On this card, we see three women dancing together in a circle. Their arms reach out to each other to connect their feelings (Cups). In many settings, women create and nurture the social glue that bonds people together. These dancing women are a symbol of coming together in love. (Of course, these feelings do not only relate to woman.)In readings, the Three of Cups can signify a friend or the feelings associated with friendship. This card can represent community - the network of support created when we interact with others. It can be any group in which the members feel a bond. When you see the Three of Cups, examine your attachments to the groups in your life from an emotional point of view. Consider reaching out to give or receive help. This card stands for all forms of support, including formal aid such as counseling and other social services.The women on the Three of Cups also express joy and high spirits.

Instead of moving forward, it turns back on itself. In the same way, we can get stuck in emotional hydraulics. The Four of Cups represents such periods of self-absorption.If you are self-absorbed, you tend to refer everything back to yourself - your own interests and desires. On this card, we see a man who is unaware of the cup being offered to him. He misses this gift because he's turned within. In readings, the Four of Cups can indicate that you are wrapped up for the moment in your own world.In some situations, you must focus on yourself. When life is too stressful, you need to devote time and energy to yourself or you will feel swamped. The Four of Cups can represent a positive period of self-reflection and renewal. By taking the time to go within to dream, muse and reflect, you restore your emotional balance.The Four of Cups is sometimes a sign of apathy. You don't really care much about anything. Your life seems stale and flat because you've lost interest in the activities that used to bring you pleasure. You're not motivated to make much of an effort in any direction. At such times, the Four of Cups can show that you're stuck emotionally. You need something to focus on that will so engage your mind and heart that your path down river becomes clear again.

On this card, we see a figure draped in black and covered in grief. He so dominates the card that it is hard to look beyond him. The Five of Cups refers to that time when the pain of a loss is most acute. This man is looking only at the overturned cups in front of him. For now, he cannot acknowledge the two cups that are still standing. Later, when he has healed somewhat, he will be able to see all that remains.In readings, the Five of Cups can alert you to the possibility of a loss and its associated emotions - sorrow, regret, denial. The loss could be great or small. It could be tangible (money, possession, relationship, work), or intangible (dream, opportunity, prospect, reputation). You may already know what this card represents, but, if not, use it as a warning to help you avoid a loss, or at least reduce its toll.You may feel discouraged by this card, but it does have a positive side. Every loss opens new possibilities for growth because every loss initiates change. Loss hurts because it is our emotional resistance to change. No matter how much we accept intellectually that we must go with the flow, if that flow separates us from what we love, our feelings say, \"No!\"In a story from Zen Flesh, Zen Bones, the master Hakuin is falsely accused of fathering a child. His reputation in the village is ruined, but he accepts this loss and takes tender care of the child for a year. Suddenly, the real father appears, and Hakuin willingly yields the child to its parents, accepting loss again. We who are not Zen masters may not flow quite so lightly with events, but we can learn from this story. The more we struggle to hold on to what is gone, the more we suffer."},{"cardID":"c6","title":"6 of Cups","suit":"Cups","links":"c6.htm","smImg":"c6s.gif","opposing":["maj15","w9","s5","s7","s9"],"reinforcing":["maj17","c10"],"prevCard":"c5","actions":[{"act":"experiencing good will","sub":["acting kindly or charitably","doing a good turn for another","sharing what you have","having a noble impulse","receiving a gift","feeling blessed","being well-intentioned"]},{"act":"enjoying innocence","sub":["feeling simple contentment","surrounding yourself with goodness","being blissfully unaware","having a clear conscience","shunning corruption","being acquitted","appreciating simple joys"]},{"act":"focusing on childhood","sub":["being with a child or young person","feeling carefree","being taken care of","feeling nostalgic","indulging in play","enjoying youthful activities","having a baby"]}],"description":"In the film Parenthood there is a scene in which all the members of a large family come together to witness a birth. As the camera moves from person to person, we see as if for the first time the uniqueness of each one. The people talk and laugh, but suddenly their actions seem anything but ordinary. There is a sweetness in the air that builds until we see its very embodiment - the new baby. This is the spirit of the Six of Cups.It is a truism that there is violence, anger and mean-spiritedness in the world. Certainly there is enough of this, but there is also much good will and caring. A mother hands a drink to her child. A friend lends his car for the weekend. A worker fills in for a sick colleague. Small gestures, barely noticed, but so important. The Six of Cups is a card of simple goodness. It encourages you to be kind, generous and forgiving.The Six of Cups also represents innocence - a word with many shades of meaning. You can be innocent in the strictly legal sense of lack of guilt. You can be innocent of the truth - unaware of some secret. You can be lacking in deceit or corruption - innocent of ulterior motive. Finally, you can be virtuous or chaste. These are all possibilities that can apply to the Six of Cups, depending on the situation.Notice that the two figures on the Six of Cups appear to be children. Often this card represents a baby or young child. In a larger sense, it embraces all of childhood and the feelings we associate with youth (ideally!) - being carefree, playful, secure and loved. Children are our treasure, and the sweetness of the Six of Cups is a quality to be treasured as well."},{"cardID":"c7","title":"7 of Cups","suit":"Cups","links":"c7.htm","smImg":"c7s.gif","opposing":["maj01","maj04","maj14","p4","p8","p9"],"reinforcing":["maj15","maj18","c9"],"prevCard":"c6","actions":[{"act":"indulging in wishful thinking","sub":["creating fantasies","dreaming","getting caught up in illusions","letting your imagination run wild","kidding yourself about the facts","building castles in the air","waiting for your ship to come in","lacking focus and commitment","avoiding putting ideas to the test"]},{"act":"having many options","sub":["being offered many alternatives","facing an array of choices","believing in limitless possibilities","looking at a wide open field","getting to pick and choose"]},{"act":"falling into dissipation","sub":["overindulging","letting everything go","becoming disorganized","eating\/drinking\/partying to excess","neglecting your health","entering into addictive patterns","being inclined toward indolence","being lazy","procrastinating"]}],"description":"As I gaze around the room right now, taking in the casual disarray, I know the Seven of Cups speaks to me - for better or worse. It says, \"Yes, order and hard work are nice, but ... isn't it more fun to just let everything go?\" Letting everything go is what the Seven of Cups is all about.It is easy to worship the gods of efficiency and neatness. We like trim lawns, alphabetized filing systems and time management - the world of the Emperor. We admire order in all its forms and want everything to be just right. The Seven of Cups provides the balance. This card stands for all that is sloppy, impractical and lax.When the Seven of Cups appears in a reading, it is important to look carefully at how disordered your situation is. Is everything too controlled and regular? Perhaps you need to let things fall apart a little. When a rigid system breaks up, there can be a tremendous release of creativity. The man on the Seven of Cups is amazed by all the options he has.On the other hand, if you are in a chaotic situation, some tightening may be necessary. No one is happy and productive in a crazy environment. Regularity gives structure to life. Taken to an extreme, the looseness of the Seven of Cups can lead to harmful patterns of decadence, addiction and self-indulgence.Sometimes the laziness applies to your thoughts and dreams. It is easy to wish for something, but not so easy to make that wish come true. When you see this card, make sure that you are backing up your plans with work and effort. Tighten up your life and commit yourself to doing what it takes to reach your goals ... even if it means (sigh) cleaning house."},{"cardID":"c8","title":"8 of Cups","suit":"Cups","links":"c8.htm","smImg":"c8s.gif","opposing":["maj08","maj19","w9"],"reinforcing":["maj09","maj13","w3","w8","s6"],"prevCard":"c7","actions":[{"act":"seeking deeper meaning","sub":["focusing on personal truth","leaving the rat race","looking for answers","concentrating on what is important","starting on a journey of discovery","finding out the facts","devoting more time to the spiritual"]},{"act":"moving on","sub":["realizing the current cycle is over","abandoning a hopeless situation","disentangling yourself","starting on a trip of unknown length","letting go","finishing up and walking away"]},{"act":"growing weary","sub":["feeling drained by demands","dragging through the day","feeling tired and listless","lacking energy","losing hope","getting weighed down by worries","becoming burned out"]}],"description":"A psychologist friend once told me that when a group is ready to break up, the members give off subtle signs to that effect. They display a certain restlessness. They arrive late to meetings, communicate less and seem distracted. At some level the participants know it is time to move on, but they need a while to work up to that final step. This process applies in many situations where an ending is approaching. Nothing is permanent in life. Sooner or later, everything slips away...or we slip away from it. The Eight of Cups stands for those moments when we realize, once and for all, that the past is gone. What was true is no longer true. The signs of change are in our face, and we must accept them. It is time to move on.Moving on can mean a physical change such as leaving a job, location or relationship. It can also mean an inner change - releasing old patterns, especially those that have dominated our thoughts and emotions. On the Eight of Cups, we see a man leaving on a journey. He has turned away from his old feelings (cups\/river) to strike out on a new path. Sometimes moving on can mean searching for a deeper truth or reality. One day we wake up and realize that we have been asleep in our own lives - living a dream that no longer satisfies.Some changes can be wearying. Endings are not always easy. One of the signs of a readiness to leave is lack of energy. When you feel tired and dispirited, you know that something is wrong, and it's time for a new direction. Reexamine your life and your priorities. You will find where in your life you need to move on.

Any cat who manages to catch one is going to feel pretty smug about it. This is the feeling tone of the Nine of Cups - pure indulgence and self-satisfaction.At the physical level, the NIne of Cups is a sign of delight in all the senses. Sights, sounds, tastes, feelings. This card encourages you to seek out pleasure and enjoy your body in every way. You can commune with the natural world as well - the body of Mother Earth. She, too, delights in sharing her abundance. At the personal level, the Nine of Cups indicates contentment with the way things are. Notice how the man is seated confidently with his arms folded and a smile on his face. He has everything he wants and couldn't be happier about it. \"See all my cups!\" he seems to say. \"Aren't they great?\"Sometimes it's wonderful to sit back and revel in the knowledge that all's right with the world. But a word of caution. You may be tempted to indulge yourself at the cost of someone else (like our mischievous cat!). This may feel great at the time, but sooner or later the feathers around your mouth will be discovered, and regret will set in. Pursuit of pleasure without regard to consequences is never satisfying in the long run.In many tarot traditions, the Nine of Cups is known as the Wish Card. It shows your wish will come true. A wonderful prospect, but remember your fairy tale lessons. You must be sure you know what you really want and accept the responsibilities that go with your wish.

The family home is in the background, surrounded by trees and water. A rainbow of cups is overhead blessing the scene.  A cynic might scoff at this romantic picture, but I see it as a symbol of what our emotional life could be at its best.  The feelings represented here are an ideal that is within the reach of each of us.First, there is joy.  Joy goes beyond happiness, contentment, enjoyment.  It is the feeling that comes when we know at the deepest level that we are one with all that is, and it is good. Unfortunately, this is not exactly a common feeling! Too often we are blinded by the trials of life and overwhelmed by their challenges.  Joy exists, though, and is our birthright.Peace is another aspect of the Ten of Cups - the serenity that comes when all elements are in harmony. There is inner peace and outer peace which are reflections of each other.  When you are in harmony with yourself, you experience harmony in your environment.  When you see the Ten of Cups, know that an end to hostility is possible.  If there is fighting around you, it may cease.  If you are at war with yourself, you may find peace.In readings, this card often signals a time of abundant blessings.  It tells you that you can reach for the fulfillment you deserve, and it will come to you.  Look for ways to realize joy and create peace.  You may find the key to happiness in your family.  Your family is the group of people you are attached to emotionally -  for better or worse!  If there is trouble in your family right now, work to restore harmony.

He's too temperamental and takes offense easily. He can't stand unpleasantness and will always let others deal with it.In readings, a Knight of Cups shows that his sensitive style is involved in the situation as an aspect of you, someone else or the atmosphere in general. You need to ask yourself, \"Is this Knight's energy helping or hurting?\"If his style is evident, then balance is needed. Are your feelings appropriate or excessive? Are your daydreams unrealistic? Is someone's moodiness driving you crazy? Is your home life ruled by emotion rather than common sense?

Her rigid posture tells us of her struggle to keep her feelings under control. She is fending off any approach from the outside. \"Nothing comes in, and nothing goes out,\" she seems to say.The Two of Swords is about the barriers we put up between ourselves and others and those we create within ourselves. Internally, we block off emotions and refuse to feel them. We avoid looking at the truth and pretend that everything's OK. We think one way, but feel another. In countless ways, we divide off parts of ourselves and try to maintain them even when we know they need to be reconciled.In readings, the Two of Swords often appears when you are not willing to accept some truth about yourself or the situation. What are you really feeling? Are you resisting tender feelings because you might be hurt? Are you furious even though you're smiling? What are you refusing to look at? Notice the blindfold on this woman. She can't look at the truth or even acknowledge that there is trouble.The most common barrier is a closed heart. When we cut ourselves off emotionally, we sever the connection that allows our love to flow outward. Sometimes this action is necessary, but it always comes at a great price. Every time we close off our heart, we find it more difficult to open again.Another barrier between people is a deadlocked situation. When two parties are set in their positions - cut off from each other - there is a stalemate. To break it, the \"opponents\" must come out from behind their swords and listen to each other. The lesson of the Two of Swords is that barriers are not the answer. We must stay open if we are to find peace and wholeness."},{"cardID":"s3","title":"3 of Swords","suit":"Swords","links":"s3.htm","smImg":"s3s.gif","opposing":["maj06","c3","c10"],"reinforcing":["c5","s9","p5"],"prevCard":"s2","actions":[{"act":"feeling heartbreak","sub":["causing heartbreak","suffering emotional pain","hurting inside","being disappointed","getting some unsettling news","having your feelings hurt","hurting someone's feelings","receiving little solace"]},{"act":"feeling lonely","sub":["being separated","wandering far from home","being spurned or rejected","feeling isolated from those you love","being deserted in time of need","feeling lost"]},{"act":"experiencing betrayal","sub":["discovering a painful truth","finding your trust misplaced","being let down","letting someone down","getting stabbed in the back","turning against someone","breaking your word","acting against"]}],"description":"You open the door to find your partner in the arms of someone else. You overhear your best friend laughing at you behind your back. You find out your business partner has been cheating you for years. All of a sudden your world is turned upside-down. You're stunned, disbelieving and finally heartbroken.The image on the 3 of Swords clearly describes this sudden pain. You literally feel as if someone has taken a sharp object and jabbed it through your heart. Even something as minor as a snippy remark can feel this way. Notice how this contains just a heart and three swords. When your heart is breaking, you feel as if that is all you are - an open wound.In readings, the Three of Swords often represents the nasty little curve balls that life can throw sometimes. Betrayal, abandonment, rejection, separation, a reversal of fortune. These hurts are painful because they hit you when you least expect them. If you have drawn this card, you may know what it refers to, but if not, the Three of Swords is a valuable warning. It is likely there is something amiss in your life that you are unaware of or unwilling to acknowledge. Curve balls hit us when we're looking the other way. Examine your situation carefully. Talk to the people in your life. Don't take anything for granted. Listen to your inner voice; it will help you locate the problem.It is also possible that you are contemplating hurting someone else. With this card I think it is important to remember that each of us is capable of cruelty. We're all human, and we all make mistakes, sometimes serious ones. In the end, all we can do is trust in the goodness of life and try to live up to that ideal.

Why is this card different? Because it represents the challenge to be quiet! Sometimes resting and doing nothing is the ultimate challenge. Activity can be a habit that is very difficult to break. There is always so much to do, and modern society beguiles us with its attractions and distractions. The result is we forget to stop and be still.In readings, the Four of Swords is often a sign that you need to slow down and get some rest. If you are recovering from an illness, allow yourself quiet time to heal. Even if you feel completely healthy, you are risking getting sick if you don't take a break.The Four of Swords also represents taking the time to think things over without hurry. It is important to step back and gain perspective. This is especially true when you are facing an ordeal or big event. You need quiet preparation time to gather your strength and center your energy. Picture an Olympic diver on the high board. She doesn't climb the ladder and then dash out. She stops, motionless as she readies herself for the burst of activity to come. This is the only way to bring the best to our endeavors.Sometimes the Four of Swords implies that you are or could be shifting focus from the external to the internal. When we are silent, we can more easily go within. The knight in the picture appears to be praying or meditating deeply. Actually, he appears to be dead! For those who are addicted to activity, rest and quiet can seem like death, but that is certainly not the case. Stillness holds its own rewards, but they must be recognized and sought."},{"cardID":"s5","title":"5 of Swords","suit":"Swords","links":"s5.htm","smImg":"s5s.gif","opposing":["maj04","maj11","maj14","c6"],"reinforcing":["w5","w7","s7"],"prevCard":"s4","actions":[{"act":"acting in your own self-interest","sub":["setting aside the concerns of others","looking out for number one","thinking of your own needs","knowing you must concentrate on yourself","encountering selfishness","indulging in power plays","gloating","going for the win-lose result"]},{"act":"experiencing discord","sub":["being in a hostile environment","feeling people are set against each other","choosing to battle","having an \"us-against-them\" mentality","creating ill will","experiencing conflict"]},{"act":"witnessing open dishonor","sub":["losing your moral compass","letting ends justify means","sacrificing integrity","losing sight of what is right","achieving a dubious victory","knowing of criminal activity"]}],"description":"The Five of Swords is about self-interest. Society tells us to think of others, yet we resist. How we can ignore our own concerns and still survive? This dilemma comes from our definition of self. If we view our self as our personality\/body, our interests become those that relate to that self. Do I have enough to eat? Am I happy? Do I have all I want?We may expand our concern to those we love, but, then, how can we stop there?  We are connected to everyone in the long run. In truth, our self is the world. What we do to that world, we do to ourselves. This understanding is so basic, but so infuriatingly easy to forget day-to-day.In readings, the Five of Swords can mean that you or someone else is forgetting this larger view of self. You are defining your interests too narrowly. If you try to get ahead in isolation, your actions will come back to haunt you later, one way or the other.Sometimes this card implies a need to put your own interests first. If you are being abused or taken advantage of, you must get free. If you are worn out by demands, take care of yourself. If it is your turn, step forward and claim your due. Just be aware that if you hurt others in the process, your victory will not feel complete.The Five of Swords also represents hostility - from a cross word to warfare. When the cords that bind us are broken, we experience dis-cord. This card can signify dishonors that are fairly open. Cheats, lies, tricks, deceits, even crimes. You may be on the receiving end, or be the perpetrator. Either way, hold to a larger view of who you are. Find the solution that is best for everyone...including yourself.

Help tells him that \"...many fears, and doubts, and discouraging apprehensions...settle in this place.\"The Slough of Despond is a good name for the Six of Swords. Sometimes this card represents a dull, listless state. Nothing is seriously wrong, but nothing is really right either. You're getting by, but not thriving. In the picture the figures in the boat seem sad and disengaged. Life is indeed uninteresting when we feel the blues.In a more positive vein, the Six of Swords can indicate recovery. This is especially true when you have just experienced a tough time or psychological blow. During the crisis, you felt numb and disconnected; nothing mattered at all. Now you are beginning to heal and pick up the pieces of your life. The travelers in our boat are at least moving forward. They are headed toward a new place, even if they are not yet ready to eagerly embrace those shores.In fact, the Six of Swords can indicate travel and moves of all kinds. This could mean an actual change of scene, relocation or trip, but not necessarily. A journey can also take place on the inner planes as we move from one frame of mind to another.Although the Six of Swords does not promise great joy, it also avoids the depths of despair.

In films, the lone-wolf hero always acts totally on his own. He discovers, investigates and solves every problem using only his own wits and resources. He believes he's successful because he ignores the fumbling efforts of ordinary people.In readings, the Seven of Swords can be a sign that you or someone else wants to be a lone wolf. You feel that you will be more effective and comfortable on your own. This approach is useful when you need to bypass an ineffectual group or assert your independence, but it can also be troubling. We cannot be happy and productive for long without some commitment to others. If you feel inclined to act alone, be sure this isolation is really working for you. Sometimes the Seven of Swords means that you are running from something - commitment, responsibility, hard work, love. You may be procrastinating, letting problems slip because you don't want to deal with them. Sometimes we just have to face what has to be faced. The Seven of Swords lets you know when you might be making things worse for yourself and others by running away.The Seven of Swords can also indicate a hidden dishonor - a choice you or another has made that does not do justice to the highest. We all make wrong choices that we want to hide. Some of these are minor, some serious. Your inner voice will tell you when this is happening. When you see the Seven of Swords, take a good look at what you're doing because hidden dishonors will eat away at your happiness and self-respect."},{"cardID":"s8","title":"8 of Swords","suit":"Swords","links":"s8.htm","smImg":"s8s.gif","opposing":["maj01","maj07","w2","w4","p3"],"reinforcing":["maj15","maj18","s10"],"prevCard":"s7","actions":[{"act":"feeling restricted","sub":["being fenced in by obstacles","staying in a limited situation","feeling trapped by circumstances","experiencing few options","being blind to freedom","feeling persecuted"]},{"act":"feeling confused","sub":["being unsure which way to turn","feeling at a loss","lacking direction","feeling overwhelmed","floundering around","needing guidance and clarity","not understanding what is happening"]},{"act":"feeling powerless","sub":["waiting for outside rescue","doubting anything you do will help","avoiding responsibility","looking for a white knight","feeling victimized","accepting inaction"]}],"description":"The woman on the Eight of Swords is lost and alone. She can't see because she is blindfolded. She can't reach out because she is bound. She can't move freely because she is caught in a prison of swords. It seems she has wandered far from home - her place of security far away on the hill. How can she get back? She doesn't even know which way to go. The Eight of Swords stands for those times when we feel lost, confused and powerless. Help and relief seems very far away.Sometimes we feel restricted by circumstances. We wake up one day in an impossible situation. A dead end job. A troubled relationship. Mountains of debt. How did this happen? We have no idea. Even little problems can make us feel trapped. There just doesn't seem to be a way out. Sometimes life seems fine - on the surface. \"I have everything I want. I should be happy, so what's the problem?\" We just don't know. We're confused and unsure.In readings, the Eight of Swords is often a sign that you are heading toward (or already in) a situation in which you will feel a lack of freedom and choice. Such situations are tricky because the more you get into them, the more restricted you feel. At each step, your options seem to narrow until you feel completely stuck.When you see this card, remember that you do have choices, and you do have power. No matter how trapped you feel, you can find a way out if you believe it is possible. The young girl in the picture could free herself. She could wriggle free, tear off the blindfold, and kick down those swords. Solutions are not always easy, but they exist. Find your clarity of thought and purpose (the Swords ideal) and use them to take that first step toward home."},{"cardID":"s9","title":"9 of Swords","suit":"Swords","links":"s9.htm","smImg":"s9s.gif","opposing":["maj17","maj20","c3","c6","c10"],"reinforcing":["maj15","w10","s3","s6"],"prevCard":"s8","actions":[{"act":"worrying","sub":["doubting all will go well","brooding","making yourself sick over your troubles","going over and over an issue","feeling anxious and tense","getting worked up"]},{"act":"feeling guilty","sub":["regretting some offense","refusing to forgive yourself","wanting to turn back the clock","focusing on your \"sins\"","being hard on yourself","denying that you did your best","getting overwhelmed by remorse"]},{"act":"suffering anguish","sub":["despairing","feeling you've reached your limits","having sleepless nights","feeling depressed","going through a dark night of the soul","forgetting joy","wanting to cry"]}],"description":"It makes sense that the figure on the Nine of Swords is in bed because it is during the night that our griefs and regrets come to mind most intensely. The quiet darkness strips away the distractions of the day, leaving us alone with our thoughts. Who has not lain awake at 4 A.M. filled with worries that refuse to go away? The Nine of Swords represents this unhappiness which can strike us at any time.Unlike the pain of the Three of Swords which seems to come from without, the Nine of Swords represents the pain that we generate from within. What tortures we put ourselves through when our fears and doubts overwhelm us. Worry is probably the most common. Have I done enough? Will everything work out OK? What am I going to do? The thoughts go round and round - impossible to turn off.Guilt is another source of pain. When we have done something that we feel is wrong or hurtful - or failed to do something we think we should have - the distress can be very real. It is worse when nothing we do relieves the bad feelings or makes them go away. Finally, there is just pure anguish. Sometimes the pain of life is so total that all we feel like doing is crying into our hands.Needless to say, the Nine of Swords is not the most pleasant of cards, but it doesn't always indicate major distress. Often it is just a sign of some element of unhappiness or trouble - a vulnerable spot in your life. This card is often a warning from your Inner Guide that the path you are going down may be a difficult one. If you approach the Nine of Swords in this spirit - as a caution sign - you will be able to use it constructively. Examine your situation carefully to be sure you are making the best choices. Even a small change can make all the difference."},{"cardID":"s10","title":"10 of Swords","suit":"Swords","links":"s10.htm","smImg":"s10s.gif","opposing":["maj07","w2","w6","c9"],"reinforcing":["maj12","s8"],"prevCard":"s9","actions":[{"act":"bottoming out","sub":["having nowhere to go but up","knowing it's darkest before the dawn","being at the lowest point","feeling things can't get worse","preparing for an upturn","reaching the pits"]},{"act":"feeling like a victim","sub":["bemoaning your fate","feeling powerless","seeing life as hostile","suffering from an attack","wondering \"Why me?\"","feeling self-pity","being on the receiving end"]},{"act":"being a martyr","sub":["putting your own interests last","being self-deprecating","feeling like a doormat","taking a back seat","letting others go first","sacrificing"]}],"description":"The Ten of Swords appears to be a card of terrible misfortune, but surprisingly, it often represents troubles that are more melodramatic than real. The man on this card has quite a few swords in his back. Wouldn't one be enough? Isn't ten a little excessive? Perhaps this gentleman's suffering - though sincere - is exaggerated as well.   One meaning of the Ten of Swords is hitting rock bottom. When one disaster follows another, we feel devastated at first, but eventually we throw up our hands and laugh. It's so bad, it's funny! In films, the hero says, \"What else could possibly go wrong?\" and we know that's a signal for the bucket of water to fall on his head. When you see the Ten of Swords, know that the last bucket has fallen, and you can expect a turn for the better.This card can also show when you're in victim mentality. You're certain that the whole world is picking on you just to make your life difficult. I picture the man lifting his head and saying, \"You think you've got it bad...a cut on the finger. I've got ten swords in my back...count 'em - ten!\" Then he drops his head back down with a sigh. When we're in victim mentality, we think everything is horrible, hopeless and impossibly unfair.Being a martyr is also a favorite Ten of Swords activity. In this case, the man would say with a weak wave of his hand, \"No...you go on. Have fun. Don't think about me. I'll just stay here with these swords in my back...but I want you to enjoy yourself.\" Being a martyr in this sense is not the same as making a sacrifice for another with no strings attached. With the Ten of Swords, either is possible, but doing a good turn for someone else is more satisfying without the strings.I don't mean to make light of misfortunes because, of course, there are many real tragedies in the world. Sometimes the Ten of Swords indicates a sad event, but you know when this is the case. There is not even a hint of laughter in your heart. Most of the time the Ten of Swords has a lighter side. It is as if your Inner Guide is gently kidding you about how you are handling your own personal tale of woe. When you see the Ten of Swords, check your attitude and know you've reached the point where things will definitely begin to look up."},{"cardID":"spg","title":"Page of Swords","suit":"Swords","links":"spg.htm","smImg":"spgs.gif","opposing":[],"reinforcing":[],"prevCard":"s10","actions":[{"act":"Use Your Mind","sub":["analyze the problem","use logic and reason","reexamine beliefs","develop an idea or plan","study or research the facts","learn or teach","think everything through"]},{"act":"Be Truthful","sub":["act honestly","face the facts","stop deceiving","clear up any confusion","expose what is hidden","speak directly"]},{"act":"Be Just","sub":["right a wrong","act ethically","treat others equally","champion a cause","try to be fair","do what you know is right","accept responsibility","acknowledge the other point of view"]},{"act":"Have Fortitude","sub":["face problems squarely","refuse to be discouraged","meet setbacks with renewed energy","keep a firm resolve","move out of depression","keep your chin up and head high","keep trying"]}],"description":"The Page of Swords is a messenger bringing you challenges.

When he thinks you are wrong, you'll know it. He's convinced of his own superiority and has little tolerance for stupidity. He expects others to comply with his views. To him, feelings are irrelevant and illogical.In readings, a Knight of Swords shows that his penetrating style is involved in the situation as an aspect of you, someone else or the atmosphere in general.  you need to ask yourself, \"Is this Knight's energy helping or hurting?\"If his style is evident, then balance is needed. Are you always forcing your position on others? Do you get in trouble for saying what you think? Is your partner too cold and aloof? Do your colleagues tend to be critical rather than supportive? It may be time for a change.If this Knight's energy is missing, a dose of clear-sightedness may be called for. Are you too emotional? Let your head rule your heart next time.

Lancelot has tapped the energy of the Two of Pentacles.There is nothing quite like the feeling of being graceful and effective at the same time. On the Two of Pentacles we see a young man dancing as he juggles his worldly concerns. The infinity sign loops around the two pentacles to suggest that he can handle unlimited problems.

The members of the team are mapping out a strategy, coordinating resources and drawing on their skills and ingenuity to complete the mission. This is the Three of Pentacles in action: teamwork, planning and competence.The Three of Pentacles is one of the cards in the Tarot that focuses on the group. (The Three of Cups and the Hierophant are the others.) As Pentacles are grounded and practical, this card represents a task-oriented team - people who are working cooperatively toward a common goal. There are few jobs that can be accomplished alone. We need the help of others to achieve our goals. Sometimes the Three of Pentacles is a sign that you will be more productive if you work with others. You don't have to do it all by yourself.This card can also show a need for planning and preparation. Now is not the time to rush into something or begin a project with only a vague idea of what it's about.

The ego tries to guarantee power by imposing its will. The desire for control is the hallmark of the Four of Pentacles.Some control is valuable. In chaotic situations, a firm hand is needed to provide structure and organization. Too often, however, the urge for control gets out of hand, stifling creativity and individual expression. In readings, this card asks you to weigh carefully the level of control in your situation.The Four of Pentacles can stand for issues of ownership.  You may be involved in getting and keeping money or some other commodity. You may be having problems with possessiveness or jealousy. Use the energy of this card to preserve and defend, but not to lay claim. People need to be free to determine their own lives.The Four of Pentacles also implies blocked change. It's as if the stubborn little man on the card is thwarting your every move. Opposition may come from those who want to maintain the status quo. It may also come from within yourself.  Are you resisting change that is truly needed? We often cling to the familiar even when we know it's not for the best.The lesson of the Four of Pentacles is that control is impossible.

They show us what it feels like to be without - to lack the basic ingredients of life. This is the specter that haunts so many in our world - a reality that is all too immediate. Those of us who are more fortunate may not have experienced this extreme, but we still recognize suffering. When we do not have what we want and need, it hurts.In readings, the Five of Pentacles can represent several kinds of lack. First, there is poor health. It is hard to tackle life's challenges when we do not have our vitality and strength. This card can be a signal that you are neglecting the needs of your body. You are moving away from complete physical well-being, so you must take steps to discover and correct the problem.This card can also be a sign of material and economic setbacks. There is no doubt that life is harder when we lack money or a decent job. When we are struggling to make ends meet, all other problems are magnified. Even if we are comfortable, we can still feel insecure, afraid that misfortune will take away all that we have worked for.The Five of Pentacles can also represent rejection or lack of acceptance. We are social animals and feel pain when excluded from our group. We want to be included, not only for our emotional well-being, but also for mutual support. Being rejected can mean physical hardship as well.The Five of Pentacles relates to material lack, but it also has a spiritual component. From the stained glass window, we can guess that these two figures are outside of a church. Comfort is so close at hand, but they fail to see it. The church symbolizes our spirits which are perfect and whole in every way. We are meant to enjoy abundance in all areas of life, but sometimes we forget that this is our birthright. Whenever you experience hardship, know that it is only temporary.

In this picture we see both sides: what it means to give and to receive, to dominate and to submit, to be on top and to be on the bottom. It seems clear who has and who hasn't, but is it? Life is not that simple, and how quickly fortunes change.In readings, the Six of Pentacles asks you to look very deeply into the whole issue of what having really means both materially (resources) and immaterially (knowledge, power, love). You may see yourself on one side or the other, but this card asks you to reconsider. Think of the successful businessman who suddenly declares bankruptcy. The tyrannical invalid who dominates through weakness. The teacher who learns from her students. The parent who controls by giving money.The keywords for the Six of Pentacles include both the have and have not sides of each meaning. Sometimes this card is a clear sign one way or the other. You will get the gift you want. You will have to defer to another. In all cases, though, you should question the obvious and go deeper. Why are you in the situation you're in, and where is it leading? Who is really in charge? What's really going on?"},{"cardID":"p7","title":"7 of Pentacles","suit":"Pentacles","links":"p7.htm","smImg":"p7s.gif","opposing":["maj10","w8","p5"],"reinforcing":["maj03","maj11","maj20","s4"],"prevCard":"p6","actions":[{"act":"assessing","sub":["evaluating the status","reflecting on progress to date","reviewing what's been done","pausing to check results","making sure you're on course","finding out where you stand","taking stock"]},{"act":"reaping a reward","sub":["finally seeing some results","enjoying the first fruits","getting returns on investments","receiving payoffs","being able to let up a bit","reaching a milestone"]},{"act":"considering a direction change","sub":["weighing a different approach","pondering alternatives","thinking about change","opening to a new strategy","questioning your choices","standing at a crossroads"]}],"description":"On the Seven of Pentacles we see a man who has labored long and hard in his garden. The foliage is full, the blossoms are out - it seems that his work has paid off. Now he's taking a break to admire his handiwork. How satisfying it is to see such fine results! How rewarding is sweet success! The Seven of Pentacles is a time-out card. It represents those moments after a rush of activity when we stop to catch our breath and look around. The man in the picture has paused to contemplate the fruits of his own labors, but he could also pick that fruit. In readings, the Seven of Pentacles can indicate a reward that will come your way, particularly as a result of your own efforts. Take it and enjoy. This card is also a call for assessment. When we're busy, we don't always have time to reflect on what we're doing and why. Are we still on course? Are we getting the results we want? Serious problems can develop if you don't take stock at key moments. In readings, this card suggests that you take the time to be sure you're meeting your goals.The Seven of Pentacles can also indicate a crossroads. In life, there's a tendency to continue with familiar routines. To go in a new direction isn't easy. The Seven of Pentacles may be telling you to figure out if you need a course correction, or even a complete about-face. You're not yet committed to a certain path, but you could be soon. Change is still possible.The Seven of Pentacles is not a card of endings or final decisions. The game is not over, but only on hold for a moment. Once you've gotten your breath back and checked your strategy, be ready to jump back in and work even harder than before."},{"cardID":"p8","title":"8 of Pentacles","suit":"Pentacles","links":"p8.htm","smImg":"p8s.gif","opposing":["c4","c7"],"reinforcing":["maj01","maj05","w9"],"prevCard":"p7","actions":[{"act":"showing diligence","sub":["making an effort","working hard","applying yourself totally","being absorbed in a project","dedicating yourself to a task","plugging away","producing steady results"]},{"act":"increasing knowledge","sub":["taking a course","learning a new craft or skill","receiving training","pursuing greater understanding","researching","finding out the facts","increasing expertise"]},{"act":"paying attention to detail","sub":["being painstaking","being extra careful","approaching a task methodically","getting down to the nitty-gritty","handling all the loose ends","checking and rechecking","noticing the fine points"]}],"description":"On the Eight of Pentacles we see a young man who is hammering away at a coin. He has finished six and has another coin to go. It is clear that he is in the middle of a project that absorbs all his attention. He's isolated himself from others (the town in the background) in order to concentrate. In this scene we see the essential elements of the Eight of Pentacles: hard work and attention to detail.This card often implies a time of great diligence and focus. It advises you to hammer away at the business of the moment, whether a work project, family difficulty, personal goal or unpleasant duty. Sometimes blessings fall into our laps to be enjoyed. Other times we must put out great effort to obtain them. The Eight of Pentacles represents moments when you must give 110%. Just buckle down and do it. Fortunately, this kind of work is invigorating and leads to superb results. The labor of the Eight of Pentacles is deeply satisfying and productive.The Eight of Pentacles can also symbolize the impulse to learn - to broaden horizons (to use an old-fashioned term). Sometimes we need to develop new skills. We do research, dig out facts or search for expertise. The Hermit is looking for inner knowledge. The man on the Eight of Pentacles seeks external knowledge - the how and why of the material world.This card can also show the need for meticulous attention. People who are painstaking are often dismissed as nit-pickers, but their extra effort ensures everything is as it should be. It's a matter of caring - taking the time to check the little details. Now is not the time to be slipshod or casual. Look for errors, and tie up loose ends. The key to success is an extraordinary effort. Whatever your task, the Eight of Pentacles tells you to give it your all in every way."},{"cardID":"p9","title":"9 of Pentacles","suit":"Pentacles","links":"p9.htm","smImg":"p9s.gif","opposing":["maj03","c7","p3"],"reinforcing":["maj07","s7"],"prevCard":"p8","actions":[{"act":"being disciplined","sub":["exercising self-control","showing restraint","reining in impulses","sacrificing to reach a goal","sticking to a program","taking a step-by-step approach"]},{"act":"relying on yourself","sub":["handling the situation alone","acting on your own","falling back on your own resources","doing it all by yourself","wanting to be alone","feeling sure your way is best"]},{"act":"pursuing refinement","sub":["achieving a comfortable lifestyle","avoiding the coarse and unsavory","being tactful and diplomatic","seeking high-minded activities","enjoying the finer things of life","remembering to be gracious","enjoying leisure"]}],"description":"The woman on the Nine of Pentacles is taking a leisurely stroll through the gardens of her estate. She is clearly a lady of refinement and grace, so it is incongruous to see on her left hand a bird trained to hunt and kill on command. Falconry is an unusual hobby for a gentlewoman, but it is the key to the special nature of this card.On one hand, the Nine of Pentacles represents all that is most gracious, high-minded and civilized. Art, music and other forms of beauty are very much part of our physical world (Pentacles). Coins are present in this scene, but they are toward the ground. The business of life is important, but we don't have to focus on practical matters all the time. We can also enjoy the finer things of life. In readings, the Nine of Pentacles can imply an interest in these areas. It is also a sign that you may need to reject the coarse or offensive and seek the highest.The Nine of Pentacles can also be a sign of discipline and self-control. This woman enjoys her cultured life because she has mastered her baser instincts. Her impulses work for her because they do not rule her. The falcon symbolizes all that is dark and unruly in human nature. Our shadow side can serve us well, but only when it is directed. Sometimes the Nine of Pentacles suggests that you must show restraint and self-control if you are to achieve your best efforts. You may have to \"sacrifice\" for the moment, but the results will be worth it.This card is also a sign of self-reliance. Sometimes you must trust our own ability to handle a situation. Resist the temptation to let others do for you. You need to take matters into your own hands. Our elegant lady has done just that. She trusted in her own grit and determination, and now she enjoys all the best life has to offer."},{"cardID":"p10","title":"10 of Pentacles","suit":"Pentacles","links":"p10.htm","smImg":"p10s.gif","opposing":["w2","w3","p5"],"reinforcing":["maj03","maj05","maj06","maj21","p4"],"prevCard":"p9","actions":[{"act":"enjoying affluence","sub":["having material abundance","being free from money problems","enjoying business success","feeling financially secure","seeing your ventures flourish","having a run of good fortune"]},{"act":"seeking permanence","sub":["looking for a solution that will last","creating a lasting foundation","feeling secure as things are","being concerned with the long-term","having an orderly family life","moving beyond makeshift arrangements","nailing down the plan"]},{"act":"following convention","sub":["staying within established guidelines","proceeding according to the rules","taking part in traditions","becoming part of the Establishment","being conservative","trusting in the tried-and-true","continuing in known patterns"]}],"description":"On many cards, we see a cluster of buildings off in the distance. In the Ten of Pentacles, we finally arrive in that village - in the middle of the marketplace. The family we see is carrying on the affairs of everyday life. A patriarch, dressed in a luxurious robe, pats his hounds as he watches over the younger generations. A man and woman converse in passing as their child plays at their feet. Coins (money) are in the air.The Ten of Pentacles stands for the ultimate in worldly and material success. Sometimes I jokingly call it the \"fat cat\" card because it reminds me of the aura of prosperity that surrounds wealthy men and women of business. This is the card you want to see if you are wondering how your latest enterprise will turn out. Wealth and affluence are yours.When we achieve material success, we naturally want it to last. This is the conservative, Establishment side of the Ten of Pentacles. Why rock the boat when life is fine just the way it is? In readings, this card often stands for convention - following established guidelines and maintaining the status quo. Fat cats are rarely radicals; they love tradition and the tried-and-true. Sometimes it is important to trust the known ways, but only when change is inadvisable.The Ten of Pentacles is also concerned with permanence. Change is an unavoidable part of life, but constant change is uncomfortable. We need stability and the chance to work for a secure foundation in life. In readings, this card may be telling you to concentrate on the long-term. Work toward a lasting solution. Now may be the time to settle down and make the arrangements that will work for you far into the future.

Every job is always completed down to the last detail. He's careful and prudent, never wasteful. He knows the facts and is immune to false promises. On the negative side, this Knight is a bit stodgy and dull. He's not known for his playful sense of humor. Work always comes first. He tends to be inflexible and obsessive about little details.

He doesn't like change or risk and will always take the gloomiest view.In readings, a Knight of Pentacles shows that his cautious style is involved in the situation as an aspect of you, someone else or the atmosphere in general. You need to ask yourself, \"Is this Knight's energy helping or hurting?\"If his style is evident, then balance is needed. Are you working too hard? Do you refuse to listen to reason? Do you have a perfectionist in your life? Is the atmosphere around you one of gloom and doom? It may be time for a change.If this Knight's energy is missing, a dose of prudence may be called for. Are you spending too much? Maybe it's time to slow down. Do you give up too soon? Dig in and refuse to quit. Is your work often careless, late or incomplete?
